![Alt text](http://www.hobbycomponents.com/images/forum/HCOPTO0014_2_800_600.JPG "Example Picture")


This Arduino library is written to work with the MAX7219 LED driver IC. The library will allow you to control one or more of these IC's that have been serially connected together. 

The library also currently supports our 8 digit 7 segment display module (HCMODU0082):

...and our 8x8 serial dot matrix display module (HCOPTO0014):

The library provides compatible commands and an alphanumeric character set for these types of modules. Future updates are planned to include other MAX7219 based products.



You will need to download and unzip this library to the Arduino development environments library area.
